Threading is a programming technique that enables a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
Threads are independent sequences of execution within a program, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance in tasks that can be divided into smaller units of work.


Synchronization in threading is the process of coordinating multiple threads to prevent interference when accessing shared resources.
It ensures that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time, preventing issues like race conditions. 
Non-synchronized threading refers to threads operating independently without coordination, potentially leading to concurrency issues.
